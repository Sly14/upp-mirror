	- fixed a nasty bug in TabWindow Detach() method which led to stack overflow error.
	  (However, this feature is still in it'a alpha stage. So, it is experimental. There may very well

2/21/2008
	* from now on, default U++ chameleon skins are used for painting the dragbar background (in default and enhanced style)
	  namely, from now on system colors applies to the Dockctrl dragbar. used skin samples are as following: 
	  default 	skin = drawed using default TabCtrl style.
	  enhanced 	skin = drawed using default ToolBar style.
	  classic	skin = no special draw action (uses current system background).

	  correctly set the cursour to the previously active tab if the dnd is cancelled.

	  incorrectly.
