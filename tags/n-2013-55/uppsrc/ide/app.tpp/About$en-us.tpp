[s0;b83; [2 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.]&]
[s0;=b83; [*/R4 Preamble]&]
[s0;b83; [2 The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General 
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share 
and change free software`-`-to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most 
of the Free Software Foundation`'s software and to any other 
program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software 
Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public 
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, 
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make 
sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software 
(and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source 
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software 
or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you 
can do these things.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities 
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify 
it.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all 
the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these 
terms so they know their rights.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the 
software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 Also, for each author`'s protection and ours, we want to 
make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty 
for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone 
else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what 
they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
by others will not reflect on the original authors`' reputations.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software 
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of 
a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect 
making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made 
it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone`'s free 
use or not licensed at all.]&]
[s0;b83; [2 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow.]&]
[s0;=b83; [*R5 GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE]&]
[s0;= [R TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*+150 0].-|[2 This License applies to any program or 
other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder 
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General 
Public License.  The `"Program`", below, refers to any such program 
or work, and a `"work based on the Program`" means either the 
Program or any derivative work under copyright law:]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [/2 that is to say, a work containing the Program or 
a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation 
is included without limitation in the term `"modification`".) 
 Each licensee is addressed as `"you`".]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification 
are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. 
 The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output 
from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a 
work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the 
Program does.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 1].-|[2 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies 
of the Program`'s source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on 
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of 
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection 
in exchange for a fee.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 2].-|[2 You may modify your copy or copies of the 
Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the 
Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under 
the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all 
of these conditions:]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 a)-|You must cause the modified files to carry 
prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the 
date of any change.]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 b)-|You must cause any work that you distribute 
or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from 
the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 c)-|If the modified program normally reads 
commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started 
running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to 
print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright 
notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying 
that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute 
the program under these conditions, and telling the user how 
to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself 
is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, 
your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 These requirements apply to the modified work as a 
whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived 
from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent 
and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its 
terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them 
as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections 
as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the 
distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, 
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, 
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim 
rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution 
of derivative or collective works based on the Program.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not 
based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on 
the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium 
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 3].-|[2 You may copy and distribute the Program (or 
a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable 
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that 
you also do one of the following:]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 a)-|Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
machine`-readable source code, which must be distributed under 
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used 
for software interchange; or,]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 b)-|Accompany it with a written offer, valid 
for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge 
no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, 
a complete machine`-readable copy of the corresponding source 
code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,]&]
[s0;l128;i150;b83;O9; [2 c)-|Accompany it with the information you received 
as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This 
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and 
only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 The source code for a work means the preferred form 
of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable 
work, complete source code means all the source code for all 
modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition 
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source 
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed 
(in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable 
runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 If distribution of executable or object code is made 
by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering 
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place 
counts as distribution of the source code, even though third 
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
code.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 4].[2 -|You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or 
distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this 
License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or 
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received 
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have 
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full 
compliance.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 5].-|[2 You are not required to accept this License, 
since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you 
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative 
works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept 
this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program 
(or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for 
copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based 
on it.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 6][2 .-|Each time you redistribute the Program (or 
any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives 
a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify 
the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not 
impose any further restrictions on the recipients`' exercise 
of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
compliance by third parties to this License.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 7][2 .-|If, as a consequence of a court judgment 
or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason 
(not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you 
(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict 
the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the 
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to 
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may 
not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty`-free redistribution of the 
Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and 
this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of 
the Program.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance 
of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole 
is intended to apply in other circumstances.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you 
to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to 
contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole 
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution 
system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of 
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent 
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide 
if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear 
what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 8][2 .-|If the distribution and/or use of the Program 
is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program 
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such 
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written 
in the body of this License.]&]
[s0;i128;b83;O9; [*5 9][2 .-|The Free Software Foundation may publish 
revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from 
time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to 
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new 
problems or concerns.]&]
[s0;l128;b83; [2 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. 
 If the Program specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and `"any later version`", you have the option 
of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
 If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation.]&]
[s0;i160;b83;O9; [*5 10][2 . If you wish to incorporate parts of the 
Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions 
are different, write to the author to ask for permission.  For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving 
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of 
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.]&]
[s0;i160;b83;O9; &]
[s0;=b83; [*/R+150 NO WARRANTY]&]
[s0;i256;b83;O9; [*5 11].[2  ][c2 Because the program is licensed free 
of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent 
permitted by applicable law._ Except when otherwise stated in 
writing the copyright holders and][2 /][c2 or other parties provide

expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied 
warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose._ 
The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program 
is with you._ Should the program prove defective, you assume 
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.]&]
[s0;i256;b83;O9; [*5 12][2 .][c2 -|In no event unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any 
other party who may modify and][2 /][c2 or redistribute the program 
as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any 
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising 
out of the use or inability to use the program ][2 (][c2 including 
but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate 
or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the 
program to operate with any other programs][2 )][c2 , even if such 
holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of 
such damages.]&]

[s0; [*/ How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [/1 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve 
this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute 
and change under these terms.]&]
[s0;/1 &]
[s0; [/1 To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It 
is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to 
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file 
should have at least the `"copyright`" line and a pointer to 
where the full notice is found.]&]

[s0; [C2  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies]&]
[s0; [C2  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 `[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  
It is]&]
[s0; [C2  numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary 
GPL.`]]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 -|-|-|    Preamble]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your]&]
[s0; [C2 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General 
Public]&]
[s0; [C2 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and 
change]&]
[s0; [C2 free software`-`-to make sure the software is free for all 
its users.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   This license, the Library General Public License, applies 
to some]&]
[s0; [C2 specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and 
to any]&]
[s0; [C2 other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use 
it for]&]
[s0; [C2 your libraries, too.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, 
not]&]
[s0; [C2 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure 
that you]&]
[s0; [C2 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and 
charge for]&]
[s0; [C2 this service if you wish), that you receive source code or 
can get it]&]
[s0; [C2 if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces 
of it]&]
[s0; [C2 in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid]&]
[s0; [C2 anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
the rights.]&]
[s0; [C2 These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
you if]&]
[s0; [C2 you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether 
gratis]&]
[s0; [C2 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights 
that we gave]&]
[s0; [C2 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
the source]&]
[s0; [C2 code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide]&]
[s0; [C2 complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink 
them]&]
[s0; [C2 with the library, after making changes to the library and 
recompiling]&]
[s0; [C2 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright]&]
[s0; [C2 the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you 
legal]&]
[s0; [C2 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Also, for each distributor`'s protection, we want to make 
certain]&]
[s0; [C2 that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this 
free]&]
[s0; [C2 library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed 
on, we]&]
[s0; [C2 want its recipients to know that what they have is not the 
original]&]
[s0; [C2 version, so that any problems introduced by others will not 
reflect on]&]
[s0; [C2 the original authors`' reputations.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software]&]
[s0; [C2 patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing 
free]&]
[s0; [C2 software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in 
effect]&]
[s0; [C2 transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent 
this,]&]
[s0; [C2 we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for 
everyone`'s]&]
[s0; [C2 free use or not licensed at all.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered 
by the ordinary]&]
[s0; [C2 GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility 
programs.  This]&]
[s0; [C2 license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to 
certain]&]
[s0; [C2 designated libraries.  This license is quite different from 
the ordinary]&]
[s0; [C2 one; be sure to read it in full, and don`'t assume that anything 
in it is]&]
[s0; [C2 the same as in the ordinary license.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries 
is that]&]
[s0; [C2 they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying 
or adding to a]&]
[s0; [C2 program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, 
without]&]
[s0; [C2 changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, 
and is]&]
[s0; [C2 analogous to running a utility program or application program. 
 However, in]&]
[s0; [C2 a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined 
work, a]&]
[s0; [C2 derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General 
Public License]&]
[s0; [C2 treats it as such.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary 
General]&]
[s0; [C2 Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software]&]
[s0; [C2 sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. 
 We]&]
[s0; [C2 concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   However, unrestricted linking of non`-free programs would 
deprive the]&]
[s0; [C2 users of those programs of all benefit from the free status 
of the]&]
[s0; [C2 libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License 
is intended to]&]
[s0; [C2 permit developers of non`-free programs to use free libraries, 
while]&]
[s0; [C2 preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change 
the free]&]
[s0; [C2 libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen 
how to achieve]&]
[s0; [C2 this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved 
it as regards]&]
[s0; [C2 changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope 
is that this]&]
[s0; [C2 will lead to faster development of free libraries.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and]&]
[s0; [C2 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference 
between a]&]
[s0; [C2 `"work based on the library`" and a `"work that uses the library`". 
 The]&]
[s0; [C2 former contains code derived from the library, while the latter 
only]&]
[s0; [C2 works together with the library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by 
the ordinary]&]
[s0; [C2 General Public License rather than by this special one.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 -|-|  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE]&]
[s0; [C2    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
which]&]
[s0; [C2 contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other 
authorized]&]
[s0; [C2 party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 
Library]&]
[s0; [C2 General Public License (also called `"this License`").  Each 
licensee is]&]
[s0; [C2 addressed as `"you`".]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   A `"library`" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data]&]
[s0; [C2 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs]&]
[s0; [C2 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   The `"Library`", below, refers to any such software library 
or work]&]
[s0; [C2 which has been distributed under these terms.  A `"work based 
on the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library`" means either the Library or any derivative work 
under]&]
[s0; [C2 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library 
or a]&]
[s0; [C2 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or 
translated]&]
[s0; [C2 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation 
is]&]
[s0; [C2 included without limitation in the term `"modification`".)]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   `"Source code`" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for]&]
[s0; [C2 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source 
code means]&]
[s0; [C2 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
associated]&]
[s0; [C2 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
compilation]&]
[s0; [C2 and installation of the library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification 
are not]&]
[s0; [C2 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The 
act of]&]
[s0; [C2 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and 
output from]&]
[s0; [C2 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute 
a work based]&]
[s0; [C2 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a 
tool for]&]
[s0; [C2 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library 
does]&]
[s0; [C2 and what the program that uses the Library does.]&]
[s0; [C2   ]&]
[s0; [C2   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library`'s]&]
[s0; [C2 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided 
that]&]
[s0; [C2 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an]&]
[s0; [C2 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep 
intact]&]
[s0; [C2 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence 
of any]&]
[s0; [C2 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring 
a copy,]&]
[s0; [C2 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange 
for a]&]
[s0; [C2 fee.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or 
any portion]&]
[s0; [C2 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 
1]&]
[s0; [C2 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices]&]
[s0; [C2     stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed 
at no]&]
[s0; [C2     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function 
or a]&]
[s0; [C2     table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses]&]
[s0; [C2     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the 
facility]&]
[s0; [C2     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to 
ensure that,]&]
[s0; [C2     in the event an application does not supply such function 
or]&]
[s0; [C2     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever 
part of]&]
[s0; [C2     its purpose remains meaningful.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     (For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has]&]
[s0; [C2     a purpose that is entirely well`-defined independent of 
the]&]
[s0; [C2     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any]&]
[s0; [C2     application`-supplied function or table used by this function 
must]&]
[s0; [C2     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the 
square]&]
[s0; [C2     root function must still compute square roots.)]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
 If]&]
[s0; [C2 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library,]&]
[s0; [C2 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in]&]
[s0; [C2 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply 
to those]&]
[s0; [C2 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But 
when you]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based]&]
[s0; [C2 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the 
terms of]&]
[s0; [C2 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend 
to the]&]
[s0; [C2 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of 
who wrote]&]
[s0; [C2 it.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest]&]
[s0; [C2 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent 
is to]&]
[s0; [C2 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative 
or]&]
[s0; [C2 collective works based on the Library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library]&]
[s0; [C2 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on 
a volume of]&]
[s0; [C2 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other 
work under]&]
[s0; [C2 the scope of this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General 
Public]&]
[s0; [C2 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. 
 To do]&]
[s0; [C2 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, 
so]&]
[s0; [C2 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, 
version 2,]&]
[s0; [C2 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 
2 of the]&]
[s0; [C2 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you 
can specify]&]
[s0; [C2 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other 
change in]&]
[s0; [C2 these notices.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible 
for]&]
[s0; [C2 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies 
to all]&]
[s0; [C2 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of]&]
[s0; [C2 the Library into a program that is not a library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion 
or]&]
[s0; [C2 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable 
form]&]
[s0; [C2 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany]&]
[s0; [C2 it with the complete corresponding machine`-readable source 
code, which]&]
[s0; [C2 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
on a]&]
[s0; [C2 medium customarily used for software interchange.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy]&]
[s0; [C2 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to 
copy the]&]
[s0; [C2 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement 
to]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute the source code, even though third parties are 
not]&]
[s0; [C2 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion 
of the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or]&]
[s0; [C2 linked with it, is called a `"work that uses the Library`". 
 Such a]&]
[s0; [C2 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, 
and]&]
[s0; [C2 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   However, linking a `"work that uses the Library`" with the 
Library]&]
[s0; [C2 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it]&]
[s0; [C2 contains portions of the Library), rather than a `"work that 
uses the]&]
[s0; [C2 library`".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.]&]
[s0; [C2 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   When a `"work that uses the Library`" uses material from 
a header file]&]
[s0; [C2 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work 
may be a]&]
[s0; [C2 derivative work of the Library even though the source code 
is not.]&]
[s0; [C2 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work 
can be]&]
[s0; [C2 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. 
 The]&]
[s0; [C2 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by 
law.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data]&]
[s0; [C2 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small 
inline]&]
[s0; [C2 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the 
object]&]
[s0; [C2 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally 
a derivative]&]
[s0; [C2 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions 
of the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library will still fall under Section 6.)]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6.]&]
[s0; [C2 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 
6,]&]
[s0; [C2 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile 
or]&]
[s0; [C2 link a `"work that uses the Library`" with the Library to 
produce a]&]
[s0; [C2 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that 
work]&]
[s0; [C2 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit]&]
[s0; [C2 modification of the work for the customer`'s own use and reverse]&]
[s0; [C2 engineering for debugging such modifications.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are 
covered by]&]
[s0; [C2 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If 
the work]&]
[s0; [C2 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a 
reference]&]
[s0; [C2 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you 
must do one]&]
[s0; [C2 of these things:]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding]&]
[s0; [C2     machine`-readable source code for the Library including 
whatever]&]
[s0; [C2     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed 
under]&]
[s0; [C2     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable 
linked]&]
[s0; [C2     with the Library, with the complete machine`-readable 
`"work that]&]
[s0; [C2     uses the Library`", as object code and/or source code, 
so that the]&]
[s0; [C2     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce 
a modified]&]
[s0; [C2     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood]&]
[s0; [C2     that the user who changes the contents of definitions 
files in the]&]
[s0; [C2     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application]&]
[s0; [C2     to use the modified definitions.)]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for 
at]&]
[s0; [C2     least three years, to give the same user the materials]&]
[s0; [C2     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more]&]
[s0; [C2     than the cost of performing this distribution.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy]&]
[s0; [C2     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy 
the above]&]
[s0; [C2     specified materials from the same place.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these]&]
[s0; [C2     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   For an executable, the required form of the `"work that 
uses the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library`" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for]&]
[s0; [C2 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special 
exception,]&]
[s0; [C2 the source code distributed need not include anything that 
is normally]&]
[s0; [C2 distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major]&]
[s0; [C2 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating 
system on]&]
[s0; [C2 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies]&]
[s0; [C2 the executable.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license]&]
[s0; [C2 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally]&]
[s0; [C2 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means 
you cannot]&]
[s0; [C2 use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library side`-by`-side in a single library together with other 
library]&]
[s0; [C2 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such 
a combined]&]
[s0; [C2 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work 
based on]&]
[s0; [C2 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise]&]
[s0; [C2 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work]&]
[s0; [C2     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library]&]
[s0; [C2     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms 
of the]&]
[s0; [C2     Sections above.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of 
the fact]&]
[s0; [C2     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining]&]
[s0; [C2     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the 
same work.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute]&]
[s0; [C2 the Library except as expressly provided under this License. 
 Any]&]
[s0; [C2 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, 
or]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate 
your]&]
[s0; [C2 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received 
copies,]&]
[s0; [C2 or rights, from you under this License will not have their 
licenses]&]
[s0; [C2 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not]&]
[s0; [C2 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to 
modify or]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions 
are]&]
[s0; [C2 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, 
by]&]
[s0; [C2 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to 
do so, and]&]
[s0; [C2 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or 
modifying]&]
[s0; [C2 the Library or works based on it.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the]&]
[s0; [C2 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify 
the Library]&]
[s0; [C2 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose 
any further]&]
[s0; [C2 restrictions on the recipients`' exercise of the rights granted 
herein.]&]
[s0; [C2 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to]&]
[s0; [C2 this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent]&]
[s0; [C2 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent 
issues),]&]
[s0; [C2 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement 
or]&]
[s0; [C2 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, 
they do not]&]
[s0; [C2 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot]&]
[s0; [C2 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations 
under this]&]
[s0; [C2 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence 
you]&]
[s0; [C2 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a 
patent]&]
[s0; [C2 license would not permit royalty`-free redistribution of the 
Library by]&]
[s0; [C2 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then]&]
[s0; [C2 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would 
be to]&]
[s0; [C2 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable 
under any]&]
[s0; [C2 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended 
to apply,]&]
[s0; [C2 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe 
any]&]
[s0; [C2 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity 
of any]&]
[s0; [C2 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 integrity of the free software distribution system which is]&]
[s0; [C2 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have 
made]&]
[s0; [C2 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed]&]
[s0; [C2 through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that]&]
[s0; [C2 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she 
is willing]&]
[s0; [C2 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee 
cannot]&]
[s0; [C2 impose that choice.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to]&]
[s0; [C2 be a consequence of the rest of this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted 
in]&]
[s0; [C2 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, 
the]&]
[s0; [C2 original copyright holder who places the Library under this 
License may add]&]
[s0; [C2 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding 
those countries,]&]
[s0; [C2 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus]&]
[s0; [C2 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation 
as if]&]
[s0; [C2 written in the body of this License.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new]&]
[s0; [C2 versions of the Library General Public License from time to 
time.]&]
[s0; [C2 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version,]&]
[s0; [C2 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If 
the Library]&]
[s0; [C2 specifies a version number of this License which applies to 
it and]&]
[s0; [C2 `"any later version`", you have the option of following the 
terms and]&]
[s0; [C2 conditions either of that version or of any later version 
published by]&]
[s0; [C2 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify 
a]&]
[s0; [C2 license version number, you may choose any version ever published 
by]&]
[s0; [C2 the Free Software Foundation.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free]&]
[s0; [C2 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with 
these,]&]
[s0; [C2 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which 
is]&]
[s0; [C2 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
Free]&]
[s0; [C2 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
 Our]&]
[s0; [C2 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the 
free status]&]
[s0; [C2 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the 
sharing]&]
[s0; [C2 and reuse of software generally.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2 -|-|-|    NO WARRANTY]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO]&]
[s0; [C2 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW.]&]
[s0; [C2 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
AND/OR]&]

OF THE]&]
[s0; [C2 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, 
YOU ASSUME]&]
[s0; [C2 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.]&]
[s0;C2 &]
[s0; [C2   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN]&]
[s0; [C2 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO 
MAY MODIFY]&]
