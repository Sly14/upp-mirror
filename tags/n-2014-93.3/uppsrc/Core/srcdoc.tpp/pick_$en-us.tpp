[s2; Transfer semantics&]
[s3; Explicit pick/clone&]
[s5; U`+`+ containers require the transfer mode (deep copy or move) 
to be explicitly specified when transfering the content of the 
container, except the case . This decision has the advantage 
of not accidentally using costly deep copy semantics, when in 
reality move is required in majority of case. Moreover, for the 
increased safety, the source after moving is considered to be 
in `"picked`" state and number of operations that can be performed 
on it is limited. In most cases, only allowed operations here 
are operator`=, destructor and Clear. This one of reasons for 
having `'pick`' function (and using term `'pick`' instead of 
`'move`', even if the semantics is about the same as `'std`::move`'.&]
[s7; Vector<int> a, b;&]
[s7; a `= pick(b); // moves content of b to a, b is put into picked 
state&]
[s7; b `= clone(a); // a and b now contain the same data&]
[s3; C`+`+03 compatibility&]
[s5; In ideal world, we would be now using only C`+`+11. In real 
world, we will need to support C`+`+03 for forseeable future.&]
[s5; pick constructor/operator`= in C`+`+11 can obviously use&]
[s7; T(T`&`&);&]
[s7; T`& operator`=(T`&`&);&]
[s5; forms. However, to support C`+`+03, we need to implement them 
using quite ugly trick as&]
[s7; T(T const`&);&]
[s7; T`& operator`=(T const`&);&]
[s5; because not doing so would break returning values from functions, 
as temporaries in C`+`+11 can only be bind to constant references. 
To hide this difference, we&]
[s7; #define rval`_ `&`&&]
[s5; in C`+`+11 and&]
[s7; #define rval`_ const`&&]
[s5; in C`+`+03 to get unified the form&]
[s7; T(T rval`_);&]
[s7; T`& operator`=(T rval`_);&]
[s5; (parameter then also has to be const`_casted, but that is not 
a problem in C`+`+11). Note also that semantics of `'pick`', 
for this reason, is not tested very well in C`+`+03.&]
[s3; Composition&]
[s5; When class contains members with pick semantics, a lot of error`-prone 
work is saved when compiler is able to generate pick constructor/operator`= 
for the class. C`+`+11 is quite capable of doing so, but often 
needs to explicitly activate it with default memebers:&]
[s7; Foo(Foo`&`&) `= default;&]
[s7; Foo`& operator`=(Foo`&`&) `= default;&]
[s5; Meanwhile, C`+`+03 does need these and does not recognize them. 
To make things easier, we define macro rval`_default, which simplifies 
this and irons out differences&]
[s7; rval`_default(Foo)&]
[s3; Optional deep copy `- clone, uniform access to deep copy&]
[s5; To support clone, class has to define special constructor of 
form&]
[s7; T(const T`&, int)&]
[s5; and to derive from DeepCopyOption<T> class, which provides support 
for static/dynamic construction of instances.&]
[s3; Changing default semantics&]
[s5; If for some reason you need version of [/ optional] deep copy 
type with [/ default] deep copy, you can easily create it with 
[* WithDeepCopy ]template&]
[s7; IntArray a `= MakeArray(100);&]
[s7; WithDeepCopy<IntArray> b(a); // b now has deep copy semantics&]
[s7; a`[3`] `= 10; //legal&]
[s7; b `= a; // deep copy&]
[s7; a `= b; // pick&]
[s7; b`[4`] `= 1; // illegal&]
[s0; ]]
