Hi Mirek!

To show you the problem of real GridCtrl and initialization in State() when reason == OPEN
I ve created this test case. In this test there is a class named... GridCtrl which paints 5 columns.
This control behave like the real GridCtrl. It computes sizes of columns in State function (original Grid
needs to do it there because it have to position transparent child control properly (that control
hold rest of child controls (edits) ).

Pleas run the application. There are two tabs.
First tab is completely created in contructor of the main App and it contains one splitter with
grid and editstring. Here everything is fine. There are 5 column visible on the left side of splitter.

Next tab has the same layout but this layout is created after pressing space key.
When you press the space the grid ctrl is passed to the splitter. As you can see there are only
2 and 1/3 of 5 columns vivible. It is happend because GetSize() in ComputeSizes() returns wrong width - width
before "splitting".

(Note that after second space grid is painted correctly!)

That case for example affects my ultimate player now where I dynamicaly create new grid control
(when user adds new playlist) and then refresh the splitter calling Vert/Horz again.


Thank you in advance for checking it and eventually fixing it!
