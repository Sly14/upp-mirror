                 Released into the Public Domain 91/04/01

1.  Introduction

    PCX_LIB is a library of functions for displaying and storing ZSoft's 
    Paintbrush (R) PCX-format image files.  It was developed expressly 
    for release into the Public Domain.  Fully commented ANSI C source 
    code is provided for all functions, along with complete technical 
    specifications for ZSoft's PCX image file format.

    Version 1.00B supports the display and storage of images on MS-DOS 
    systems equipped with the following display adapters:

      Hercules  - monochrome
      CGA       - Color Graphics Adapter
      EGA       - Enhanced Graphics Adapter
      MCGA      - MultiColor Graphics Adapter
      VGA       - Video Graphics Adapter

    All valid MS-DOS graphic modes are supported.

    SuperVGA and XGA display adapters are not supported in this release.

                                                                     p. 3

4.  Trying It Out

    Four test images are included on the disk, one each for MS-DOS video 
    modes 4, 6, 16 and 19. 


4.1.  PCX_EXAM

      PCX_EXAM reads a PCX-format image file and displays a summary of 
      the information contained in the file header.  A full explanation
      of this information is presented in PCX_FMT.DOC.

      To run PCX_EXAM with a file (e.g. - "MY_PICT.PCX"), enter:

        PCX_EXAM my_pict.pcx


4.2.  RD_DEMO

      To display any of these images, enter:

        RD_DEMO test_xx.pcx xx

      where "xx" is the video mode (e.g. - "RD_DEMO test_06.pcx 6").  
      Your display adapter must be capable of emulating the specified 
      video mode in order to display the image.

      Once the image is displayed, press any key to clear the screen and 
      return to DOS.

      RD_DEMO will also display a PCX-format image if your display 
      adapter supports its appropriate video mode.  For example, to 
      display a PCX-format image file "MY_PICT.PCX" that was created for 
      display on 320 x 200 256-color VGA displays, enter: 

        RD_DEMO my_pict.pcx 19


4.3.  WR_DEMO

      The demonstration program WR_DEMO will first display a PCX-format 
      image file, then capture the image directly from the display 
      adapter's memory and create a PCX-format image file called 
      "PCX_DEMO.PCX".

      To run WR_DEMO, enter:

        WR_DEMO test_xx.pcx xx
  
      where "xx" is the video mode (e.g. - "WR_DEMO test_06.pcx 6").  
      Your display adapter must be capable of emulating the specified 
      video mode in order to display and capture the image.


                                                                     p. 4

      Once the image is displayed, WR_DEMO will automatically capture 
      it and create the file "PCX_DEMO.PCX" before clearing the screen 
      and returning to DOS.

      WR_DEMO will also display and capture a PCX-format image if your
      display adapter supports its appropriate video mode.  For example, 
      to capture a PCX-format image file "MY_PICT.PCX" that was created 
      for display on 320 x 200 256-color VGA displays, enter: 

        WR_DEMO my_pict.pcx 19

      WR_DEMO captures the entire screen and all color planes, so the
      size of the resultant PCX_DEMO.PCX file may be different than the
      file it displayed.

5.  Using The Library

    The public functions in PCX_LIB (i.e. - those meant to be called by 
    application programs) are:

      pcx_read          - display a PCX-format image file
      pcx_write         - capture a displayed image to a PCX-format file

      pcx_isvga         - determine whether a display adapter supports
                          VGA BIOS calls

      pcx_init_dsa      - set up BIOS to capture EGA color palette
                          register updates
      pcx_free_dsa      - reset BIOS to state before call to 
                          "pcx_inst_dsa"

    All functions are fully and exhaustively documented in the source 
    code files.  Example calls to the public functions may be found in 
    the source code files RD_DEMO.C and WR_DEMO.C.
