[s2; Reporting bugs&]
[s0; If you feel that something does not work as it should, the most 
effective way how to proceed is to post a message in the [^http`:`/`/ultimatepp`.org`/forum^ f
orum]. The usual ethics apply here the same way as on most of 
the forums all over the Internet: Before posting, [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forum`/index`.php`?t`=search`&^ c
heck] if the problem isn`'t already reported. Please, make sure 
that you are posting to the correct forum section. If you experience 
problem with library, make sure to post to [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forum`/index`.php`?t`=index`&cat`=16`&^ U
`+`+ Library support]. Problems with TheIDE should be reported 
to [^http`:`/`/www`.ultimatepp`.org`/forum`/index`.php`?t`=index`&cat`=10`&^ U`+`+ 
TheIDE]. Note that some sections have sticky posts, please read 
them before posting, they usually contain important information.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; You should always provide the information about your system, 
as it often helps when reproducing your problem. Usually writing 
down the version of U`+`+, your operating system and compiler 
is enough. If the problem is TheIDE related, include also the 
version of TheIDE `- it can be found in the About`-box (Assist 
> About ...). In some special cases we might ask for more details 
if it is necessary.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Also please [*/ DO NOT] post bugs to [*/ Bugs (`& fixes)] forum 
directly. Use the category best describing your problem, they 
will be moved later if necessary.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Whenever possible, please add a simple piece of code (a `"[*/ testcase]`") 
that demonstrates the problem to your report. When the developers 
know how to reproduce the problem, there is much higher probability 
that fix will be released soon. In simple words: Problem reproduced 
is usually a problem solved. If the testcase is single file only, 
just post the code into the forum post. If it is more complex, 
you can use .zip attachment.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; One picture is worthed thousand words, as the old saying goes. 
If you experience any kind of rendering problems, including a 
[*/ screenshot] helps very much and saves you some typing.&]
[s0; &]
[s2; Submitting patches&]
[s0; If you are find a bug and you also happen to be capable of solving 
it, we would be very thankful if you post your solution. The 
same also applies if you find a solution to bug reported by someone 
else.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; If the patch changes only small part of code, the preferred 
method is to post only changed functions or classes in the post 
text. To make it easier for people reviewing the patch, you should 
also write in which files the changed code resides. If there 
are more files affected, the best is to simply post all changed 
files in .zip as attachment.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Sometimes people ask why we don`'t use `*.diff or `*.patch files. 
The reason is very simple: U`+`+ is multiplatform framework and 
there exist many different formats for diff/patch. So while these 
utilities were initially created to save work, it actually sometimes 
acts just opposite. That said, we don`'t refuse patches in diff 
format. We will try to apply them, but if they are not compatible 
with the tools we use, we will ask you to provide the changes 
in different format. So to save work on both sides, we prefer 
posting the changed code or whole files.&]
