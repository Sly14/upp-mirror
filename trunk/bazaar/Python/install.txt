to make python work in upp there are few steps to do..

go to the python page 
http://www.python.org/getit/

and choose the installer for windows, version 2.7.1 is good and current.
linux should have python 2.7.1 already shipped.

the windows installer will put it in 'C:\Python27' folder

setup your build method for windows to add to PATH:
C:\Python27
to INCLUDE
C:\Python27\include
to LIB
C:\Python27\
C:\Python27\libs
C:\Python27\DLLs

again, linux should already have python available from start.

make sure NOT to choose DEBUG compile, since it will fail. the reason:
python27 headers need some more functions in debug mode, which are not provided in release lib.
but the Upp Python package is ready to be used as DEBUG as well. if needed, read on.


DEBUG:
debug is needed, when you need to debug at least *your* application. so you will need
the target library for DEBUG, named python27_d.dll / python27_d.so respectively.

for linux, download the python debug package which should be available for your distro
or recompile it from source with the needed flags for configure.

for windows you will need to compile it from source, because, it is not provided in installation.
download the sources at same location or directly
http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/Python-2.7.1.tgz
extract and move the Python-2.7.1 folder with the sources to C:\

go to C:\Python-2.7.1\PCbuild
and open the pcbuild.sln with VisualStudio 2008, or express, should do as well.
do a 'build solution', which will fail in some packages, ssl and the like. no matter..

PCbuild folder will contain the files
	python27_d.dll
	python27_d.lib
	python27_d.pdb
	python27_d.exp

copy the dll to C:\Python27
and the remaining 3 files to C:\Python27\libs

this should enable you to compile your app as DEBUG..
