SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR maxpdf CUPS DRIVER

1) Build the app using theide

2) Copy the executable 'maxpdf_frontend' in your bin folder /usr/bin
	Check that it has executable permission for all

3) Copy the shell script 'maxpdf' to cups backend folder
	(usually /usr/lib/cups/backend); make it executable for all
	If your bin path is NOT /usr/bin you should edit it accordingly;
	the paths are in first lines after copyright notice.
	
4) Copy the prinder description file 'maxpdf.ppd' inside cups driver
	folder; it should be '/usr/share/ppd/'.
	
5) Now the tricky part; you MUST tell sudo that cups can execute it
	without password. Usually cups subsystem works on behalf of 'lp'
	user, so add this line to '/etc/sudoers' :
	
		lp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
		
	You will have something like this inside your '/etc/sudoers' file :
	
		.......................
		# User privilege specification
		root	ALL=(ALL) ALL
		lp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
		.........................
		
	If your cups works on behalf of other user than 'lp', change it
	accordingly; it should not happen anyways.
	BEWARE... /etc/sudoers SHOULD be edited only by 'visudo' command.
	
6) There are some problems with X11 authentications too, at least, that
	happened to me. Ubuntu default don't allow 'lp' user to open an X11
	display. If you're not sure about, just issue following command, it
	does no harm :
	
		xhost +LOCAL:
		
	It will allow X11 displays for ALL local users.
	
7) Open cups printer manager and select 'add printer'. If it's all ok,
	a new 'maxpdf' local printer should appear. Select it and as driver
	choose 'maxpdf' as manufacturer and printer driver.
	
	
ENJOY !
