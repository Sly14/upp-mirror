[s0; [2 MAPIEx handles Microsoft Outlook elements as messages, folders, 
contacts and appointments through Extended MAPI (Message API).]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 With MAPIEx you can check email folders, open and save emails 
including images and attachments, create contacts or delete emails 
and folders. Many simple examples are included in MAPIEx`_demo 
package.]&]

[s0; [2 MAPIEx is a wrapper of ][^http`:`/`/www`.mud`.ca`/MAPIEx`.zip^2 Noel 
Dillabough CMAPIEx library][2  It contains code from ][^http`:`/`/www`.wischik`.com`/lu`/programmer`/mapi`_utils`.html^2 L

[s0; [2 The main changes in relationship with original code have been:]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0;i150;O0; [2 `"new`" and `"delete`" are not necessary in user program. 
No heap errors are expected as now all user variables are in 
the stack. In addition internal use of heap has been reduced.]&]
[s0;i150;O0; [2 The library interface from user point of view has been 
simplified. GetContents() and GetHierarchy() use is now private.]&]
[s0;i150;O0; [2 To improve compatibility CString and TCHAR have been 
removed. They have been substituted by String.]&]
[s0;i150;O0; [2 Added documentation.]&]
