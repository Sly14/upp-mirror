[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 Ultimate documentation is growing and is available in TheIde 
and Upp applications through Topic`+`+ help technology.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 However some of us think that there is a space for a well structured 
book including the documentation from the beginners side to the 
reference guide and appendixes with Bazaar projects. ]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 Easy to read in the introduction areas, but complete in the 
reference areas, with many examples and following Upp design 
style. ]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 All the docs in one place instead of in different help pages, 
so easier to be distributed.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 To do it from the scratch would be an astonishing job. Now 
there are hundreds of pages already in T`+`+ documentation. And 
they have to be periodically updated.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 So why not have both things at the same time ?: Based in Upp 
technology we can have a help system and a book with only one 
effort.]&]
[s0;2 &]
[s0; [2 Join to prepare the required software and redefine the actual 
help pages to be compatible with the book.]&]
