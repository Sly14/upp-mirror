TITLE("New official version 0.98.0 is released. This release is without compiler, instead download compiler separately and TheIDE automatic setup takes care about configuring it. You can use either MinGW compiler system or free Microsoft(R) Visual C++(TM) Toolkit 2003. Support for later is greatly improved as TheIDE now provides a native PDB debugger. Other important improvements are code browser and a new documentation system - Topic++.")
