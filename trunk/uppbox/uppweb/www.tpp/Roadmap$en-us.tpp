[s0;i150;O0; U`+`+ abandoned `"default pick`" semantics for containers. 
The transfer semantics now has to be specified explicitly, either 
as `'[* pick]`' or `'[* clone]`' (this is enforced in C`+`+11 mode, 
in legacy mode old behaviour is maintained and pick/clone are 
optional).&]
[s0;i150;O0; New containers, based on fast`-insertion arrays: [* InVector, 
InArray, SortedIndex, SortedVectorMap, SortedArrayMap]. SortedIndex, 
SortedVectorMap and SortedArrayMap provide binary searches, while 
maintaining random access to the array, with performance comparable 
to binary tree based containers (e.g. std`::map).&]
[s0;i150;O0; New [* Core/POP3] package `- support for retrieving emails 
form POP3 servers.&]
[s0;i150;O0; Initial round of C`+`+11 support (lambda callbacks, 
minor fixes)&]
[s0;i150;O0; A set of small utility functions [* findarg], [* decode], 
[* min]/[* max] now supporting more arguments. [* SplitTo ]and [* Merge] 
for splitting/merging strings.&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* InFilterStream], [* OutFilterStream] classes that can 
provide some sort of processing (e.g. compression) to regular 
streams.&]
[s0;i150;O0; New Date related functions [* EasterDay], [* GetMonths], 
[* GetWeek], [* GetWeekDate].&]
[s0;i150;O0; MIME / fileextension mapping functions [* FileExtToMIME 
]and [* MIMEToFileExt].&]
[s0;i150;O0; Some ARMv7 related optimization (unaligned access, byte 
swaps).&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* SpinLock] class.&]
[s0;i150;O0; Stream optimization methods [* GetPtr], [* PutPtr], [* GetSzPtr] 
provide safe access to Stream internal buffer.&]
[s0;i150;O0; String/WString`::[* Find](const String`&) significantly 
speed optimized.&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* Value] invalid casts now throwing exception [* ValueTypeError] 
instead of panic.&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* WebSocket] class.&]
[s0;i150;O0; `[[* Stable]`][* SortBy]`[[* Keys]`|[* Values]`] functions for 
sorting VectorMap, ArrayMap.&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* plugin]/[* lz4 ]`- adapted fast compression library&]

ValueArrays, new [* CreateCtrl]<T> method.&]
[s0;i150;O0; LineEdit heavily optimized to be able to work with huge 
files (>100MB).&]
[s0;i150;O0; LineEdit now able to work with [* rectangular selections.]&]
[s0;i150;O0; [* DDARasterizer] and [* SDraw] are new tools providing 
Draw with minimal host platform support (only two operations, 
paint Image and paint colored rectangle, are required).&]
[s0;i150;O0; Image rescaling now supports varios filters, like bicubic 
or lanczos.&]
[s0;i150;O0; AttrText is now rich comparable Value: it is now possible
