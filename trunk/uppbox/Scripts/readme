Use 'make' to compile TheIDE. It will be generated to your home directory.

Use 'make install' to prepare standard U++ environment. It will create ~/upp
directory to store U++ library sources, MyApps to store your application
sources and ~/upp.out as output for intermediate files.

Then start playing with U++ by invoking ~/theide.
