SCRIPTS TO BUILD DEBIAN PACKAGES FROM VARIOUS UPP REPOSITORIES
By Massimo Del Fedele (max@veneto.com)

User scripts are :

dosvn		to build a debian from a local SVN repository
dostable	to build a debian from a local upp stable tree

Other scripts are just helpers for main scripts.

USAGE :

1)	Prepare local source repositories.
	For svn, you'll need to do an 'svn checkout'. See svn user guide and/or sourceforge instructions
	For beta/devel/stable packages, just download source tarball from upp site and unpack in a local folder

2)	You MUST have Upp executables installed. It doesn't matter if from stable, beta or svn packages,
	but a working IDE is needed. If you still don't have it, just install a debian svn package
	downloadable from forum.

3)	Edit doXXX scripts to adjust your local paths (repositories, destination path)
	Paths are set on scripts beginning -- see comments

4)	Just run the requested script

The debian package(s) are put in your selected destination folder.
On errors, you'll get some error messages from scripts.

Enjoy !
