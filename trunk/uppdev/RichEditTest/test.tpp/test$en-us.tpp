texts).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is 8`-bit format. Characters 0`-31 are ignored (with exception 
of 1 `- see bellow). Other characters are copied into resulting 
RichText, excluding characters that form formatting commands.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Letters ([@4 a]`-[@4 zA]`-[@4 Z]), numbers ([@4 0]`-[@4 9]), characters&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*@4 . , ; ! ? % ( ) /]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; and characters greater than 128 are guaranteed to be never used 
as command characters (not even in future versions of QTF). Other 
characters should be prefixed with escape character `` (reverse 
apostrophe). Group of characters can be escaped using character 
1. Example:&]
[s0; &]
[s2; `"`\1a`[x`]`\1`[`* bold`]`"&]

[s0; Dimension units of QTF are dots `- one dot is defined as 1/600

texts).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is 8`-bit format. Characters 0`-31 are ignored (with exception 
of 1 `- see bellow). Other characters are copied into resulting 
RichText, excluding characters that form formatting commands.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Letters ([@4 a]`-[@4 zA]`-[@4 Z]), numbers ([@4 0]`-[@4 9]), characters&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*@4 . , ; ! ? % ( ) /]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; and characters greater than 128 are guaranteed to be never used 
as command characters (not even in future versions of QTF). Other 
characters should be prefixed with escape character `` (reverse 
apostrophe). Group of characters can be escaped using character 
1. Example:&]
[s0; &]
[s2; `"`\1a`[x`]`\1`[`* bold`]`"&]

[s0; Dimension units of QTF are dots `- one dot is defined as 1/600

texts).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is 8`-bit format. Characters 0`-31 are ignored (with exception 
of 1 `- see bellow). Other characters are copied into resulting 
RichText, excluding characters that form formatting commands.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Letters ([@4 a]`-[@4 zA]`-[@4 Z]), numbers ([@4 0]`-[@4 9]), characters&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*@4 . , ; ! ? % ( ) /]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; and characters greater than 128 are guaranteed to be never used 
as command characters (not even in future versions of QTF). Other 
characters should be prefixed with escape character `` (reverse 
apostrophe). Group of characters can be escaped using character 
1. Example:&]
[s0; &]
[s2; `"`\1a`[x`]`\1`[`* bold`]`"&]

[s0; Dimension units of QTF are dots `- one dot is defined as 1/600

texts).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is 8`-bit format. Characters 0`-31 are ignored (with exception 
of 1 `- see bellow). Other characters are copied into resulting 
RichText, excluding characters that form formatting commands.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Letters ([@4 a]`-[@4 zA]`-[@4 Z]), numbers ([@4 0]`-[@4 9]), characters&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*@4 . , ; ! ? % ( ) /]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; and characters greater than 128 are guaranteed to be never used 
as command characters (not even in future versions of QTF). Other 
characters should be prefixed with escape character `` (reverse 
apostrophe). Group of characters can be escaped using character 
1. Example:&]
[s0; &]
[s2; `"`\1a`[x`]`\1`[`* bold`]`"&]

[s0; Dimension units of QTF are dots `- one dot is defined as 1/600

texts).&]
[s0; &]
[s0; It is 8`-bit format. Characters 0`-31 are ignored (with exception 
of 1 `- see bellow). Other characters are copied into resulting 
RichText, excluding characters that form formatting commands.&]
[s0; &]
[s0; Letters ([@4 a]`-[@4 zA]`-[@4 Z]), numbers ([@4 0]`-[@4 9]), characters&]
[s0; &]
[s0; [*@4 . , ; ! ? % ( ) /]&]
[s0; &]
[s0; and characters greater than 128 are guaranteed to be never used 
as command characters (not even in future versions of QTF). Other 
characters should be prefixed with escape character `` (reverse 
apostrophe). Group of characters can be escaped using character 
1. Example:&]
[s0; &]
[s2; `"`\1a`[x`]`\1`[`* bold`]`"&]

[s0; Dimension units of QTF are dots `- one dot is defined as 1/600
