	EZ Common is the library serving other parts of EZ Project, defining
common types, I/O functionalities, etc.
	EZ Project uses an enum type to define function return values. The
possiblities are, critical errors, minor errors, no significant errors, right
and unknown. Please turn to header file for their comments.
	ezoi is a standard I/O class for screen or file(s). If screen input is
needed, invoke st() first, then inpt(), and rst() at last, to function
friendly when only one character's needed to be entered (no Enter's required).
dsp() is the common interface to output in format. mem() is for more specific
usage. Use ind() to output in raw, though in format, too, directly. To
minimize the dependency of the library caller and the library implementation,
ezoip member is defined inside ezoi to shield private details.
