	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- fixed a nasty bug in TabWindow Detach() method which led to stack overflow error.
	  (However, this feature is still in it'a alpha stage. So, it is experimental. There may very well
	  be bugs... USE IT AT YOUR RISK!)
	- fixed tab dragging bug which cause to trigger the StartWindowDrag() in tab frame's empty area.
	- ResetLayout() method fixed and renamed to ResetWidgetLayout(). 
	- the tabs and tabbed window title showed incorrect info(title, icon) in  "nested tabbing" mode
	  and in "tabbed autohide" mede. this bug is fixed for both mode by adding 
	  RefreshTabWindowLabel() method to TabWindow class.
	- other internal and minor bugfixes.
	* removed irrelevant packages from the assembly :) (remnants of my early experiments...)
	* DockCtrlExample is added to the package. now the main package is named DockCtrl Dev802b.2
	* default and enhanced background skins are polished. now they have more native look.
